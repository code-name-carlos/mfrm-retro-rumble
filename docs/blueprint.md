# **App Name**: Retro Rumble

## Core Features:

- Battle Screen UI: Display a retro-themed battle screen with health bars for the player and opponent.
- Move Selection: Enable users to select their move (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock) using on-screen buttons with 8-bit pixelated icons.
- Gesture Recognition: Use the device camera to recognize hand gestures and translate them into gameplay actions. Inform the user if the gesture recognition tool fails.
- Game Logic: Implement the game logic to determine the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Purple (#8E2DE2) for a vibrant, cyberpunk feel on the background.
- Secondary color: Neon Yellow (#FEE440) for interactive elements and buttons, providing a sunny retro contrast.
- Accent: Hot Pink (#FF69B4) to highlight player actions, health bars, and key UI elements for emphasis.
- Use 8-bit pixelated icons for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock, with a neon glow effect.
- Design the layout similar to classic battle screens, but with a modern twist incorporating neon borders and animated pixel dust effects. Add home screen elements inspired by the shared prototype.
- Implement simple, pixelated animations for attacks and impacts, with added visual effects like scanlines and chromatic aberration to enhance the retro-cyberpunk aesthetic.

## Original User Request:
Help me build a rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock application in Next.js with firebase integration. I want the gameplay style to be similar to pokemon where you battle another person and you can choose a move of yours before the battle / animation phase. It would be great to do this in a retro theme, 8-bit pixelated art seems appropriate. I want the option to select the gameplay action (rock, paper, scisscors, l.izard, or spock) either as an option in the UI or ability to use my camera to see my hand gesture that should translate into my gameplay action. I will share with you concepts that I premade with other AIs, so I want to reference it but come up with your own style of course.
